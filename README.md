# SmartTrackR
An Android App to track visitors in an event which has many stalls(like a fair). The app provides the event organisers with live
participant movement with additional data such as the the amount of time the participant stay at a particular stall and their movement 
trajectory. 

The app is built with Parse which serves as the backend and stores all participant data. 

Developed at the New York Life Hackathon with Leon Chang and Min Thu Aung.
